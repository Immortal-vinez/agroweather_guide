# Crops Screen Improvements - AgroWeather Guide

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Before:** When users tapped the "Crops" button in the bottom navigation, they either saw:
- A specific crop's details (if one was previously selected)
- A message saying "Select a crop to view details"

This was confusing and not user-friendly.

**After:** Tapping the "Crops" button now opens a comprehensive **Crops List Screen** that shows all available crops with search, filter, and smart recommendations!
